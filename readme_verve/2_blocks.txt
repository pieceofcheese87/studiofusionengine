TL;DR: This engine changes how block collision works, but you shouldn't need to use it much differently from what you're
used to. Mark blocks as solid and give them objBlock as parent.

For the player to collide with blocks, they now only need to be marked solid, it is no longer tied to objBlock specifically
in any way. However, such a generalization could not have been made for the blood splatter, which checks for objBlock
specifically, hence why it's useful to have all other solids keep objBlock as parent.

The blood specifically sticks to any object in the array set in its Create code.
