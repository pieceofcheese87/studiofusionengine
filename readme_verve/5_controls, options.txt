The process of adding new configurable controls has been streamlined. The script scrControls holds every block of code
you need to add a line to in order to add a new key. This includes adding a new value to the key enum, and 8 lines to
the various blocks in the switch afterwards, handling loading, saving, getting the name and reseting to default,
times two for controller binds.

The button arrays have been condensed into one global.controls array, and instead of array names you now use a key enum.
scrButtonCheckPressed(global.shootButton) would now be scrButtonCheckPressed(KEY.SHOOT). For a list of the key names,
check scrControls.



The options system has been replaces entirely with the modular option scripts taken straight out of renex engine. Each
option gets its own script in the Options folder, and scrOptionsList then holds a list of all of those options. You can
use any of the scripts for reference as to how they work, and a template is provided for making a new one.

If you for example want a new global variable that you can switch on and off in the options, you can copy optSmoothing
and edit it to fit your variable. Then all you need is to add the option to scrOptionsList, and add the variable to
scrSave/LoadConfig so it actually saves.
