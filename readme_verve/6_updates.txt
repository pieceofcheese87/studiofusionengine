The engine features version checking, similar to the one in jTool (on which I in fact based the code). By default it is
disabled in scrSetGlobalOptions. There, you can link to a raw text file, most easily on pastebin or GitHub. You will need
access to edit this file later, so if you're using pastebin make sure you have an account.

The version name is a string, and the game only considers an exact match the up to date version. If the file ever link
gets broken or in any way taken down, the rest of the game will still function properly as if update checks were disabled.

If you check the example pastebin file (https://pastebin.com/raw/Z5sWFNap), you'll notice it's only the raw text instead
if anything looking like an actual website. This is important! To access the raw text, you can click the "Raw" button on
either pastebin or GitHub.
