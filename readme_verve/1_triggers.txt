TL;DR: Triggers are now made differently and are much more powerful. Check sample room for examples and
the Trigger scripts folder for a full list.

The two biggest changes to the trigger system are the removal of trigger variants of objects, instead allowing for any
object to be made triggerable, and a significant expansion of trigger effects directly inspired by RedBatNick's engine.
Locked triggers are also reintroduced as they were ommited in YoYoYo engine.

objTriggerManager is the object taking care of all trigger behavior, with the individual options being defined in indi-
vidual scripts in the Trigger scripts folder. You shouldn't ever need to place objTriggerManager, instead calling
scrMakeTrigger() in an object's Creation code. You can pass the trigger id as an argument instead of specifying it later.
The script returns the id of the newly made objTriggerManager instance, meaning the intended use case would be something
like:
with(scrMakeTrigger("fall"))
{
    ...
}

As you can see, strings are also valid trigger ids now. You can check the sample room for several examples of triggers.

Now that you have your object react to a trigger, you need to define what it actually does. The most convenient way to do
this is by calling a trigger script. You can open each script for a detailed explanation of what it does. Behaviors that
move the instance are special in that you can only use one at a time: You can't have an instance follow a path and have
gravity, etc. Other than that, you can mix any of the other triggers together.
For example:
with(scrMakeTrigger("fall"))
{
    trgMove(0, 5); 
    trgSound(sndCherry, 1);
}

If you assign a trigger to a moving object, it will work the same until it is triggered, when the objTriggerManager
takes control of the instance's movement, unless the trigger doesn't have a movement action set - see fading out
platforms in the sample room.

Trigger objects get used as usual, except they can now be locked by setting the key variable to a trigger id.
Locked triggers do not get activated until the trigger with the key id gets activated first.
Additionally, triggers can play sounds and destroy themselves on activation, see the objTrigger Create event.

To make new trigger behavior, look at the existing ones for reference and use a copy of trgTemplate as a start.
Don't forget to then add your new script to scrTriggerList.
