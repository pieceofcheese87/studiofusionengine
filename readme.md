#Not Another Needle Engine

###Current version: 1.3 (2022-07-29)

This is an engine originally designed for use in "Not Another Needle Contest" (NANC) that has been expanded to include many gimmicks from various fangame sources.
The engine is intended to be used by beginner and experiences makers alike as a convenient collection of common features found in fangames.

Previously based on the YoYoYo Engine, it is now based on the Verve Engine. (Though they share a very similar structure)
