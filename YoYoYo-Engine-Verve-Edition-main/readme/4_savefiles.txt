Saving and loading file data works roughly the same as it did in YoYoYo, however the process has been simplified and
hopefully cleaned up a bit, now you only have to add 1 line to save your variables and 1 to load it, halving the amount
of steps needed previously. In scrSaveGame, add code at the bottom of the big if block, and in scrLoadGame add code
near the very bottom, simply by following how the other variables are saved. The order of the lines doesn't matter much,
and there are comments telling you where to put the code so the should be nothing to worry about.

If you want to save a variable without actually saving the game, e.g. saving a secret item immediately after it's picked
up, in the item object you would set both the global.secretItem[0] as well as global.saveMap[? "secretItem0"], and then
call scrSaveGame(false). This will save the item even if the player restarts immediately.
