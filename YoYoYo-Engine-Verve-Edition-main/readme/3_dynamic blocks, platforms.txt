Dynamic blocks are this engine's equivalent of RandomFangamer's betterblocks. They will simply push and carry the player
around when moved and scaled. You can additionally make any object affected by dynamic blocks using the script
scrDynamicCollision, placing it once in Create and once in End Step. Look in the script for instructions or the player
object for an example.

Platforms have a new snap variable. By default, you always get snapped when jumping through one, compared to the former
snap which happened most of the time depending on how the vstrings felt. Setting snap to false will make that platform
never snap.

The global game settings feature two related options:
platformsPhase - Sets whether platforms let the player fall through when pushing them against a ceiling, or whether they
get pushed into it. This would then either kill the player or leave them stuck depending on the other setting.
blocksCrush - Sets whether dynamic blocks and platforms crush the player when pushing them against a wall, otherwise
leaving them stuck in the block.
